Predictions for four CYP isoforms — CYP3A4 · CYP2D6 · CYP2C9 · CYP1A2 — scored against the challenge's own official evaluation code, not a reimplementation.

📊 Results

Validated on a held-out, structure-aware split, scored with the challenge's official evaluation/ code.

Direct Inhibition (Regression)
Isoform	ST-RAE ↓	MAE ↓	R² ↑
🟢 CYP3A4	0.532	0.573	0.561
🟢 CYP2C9	0.616	0.482	0.404
🟡 CYP1A2	0.907	0.690	0.179
🔴 CYP2D6	0.966	0.597	0.105
🎯 Macro (MA-ST-RAE)	0.755	0.585	0.312
Time-Dependent Inhibition (Classification)
Isoform	MCC ↑	Threshold
🟢 CYP3A4	0.354	0.45
🟡 CYP2D6	0.126	0.45

🟢 solid · 🟡 weak-but-real signal · 🔴 struggling — see Limitations

🗂️ Data
Source	Config	Rows	Used for
openadmet/cyp-challenge-train-test	default	~4,900	pIC50 + credible intervals
openadmet/cyp-challenge-train-test	tdi	~4,900	CYP3A4/CYP2D6 TDI labels
Official blinded set	—	750	Final predictions

TDI labels are used as provided, not re-derived — consistent with the official rule: positive if the TDI-arm shift exceeds 2-fold relative to direct inhibition, with inferred positives for low-activity compounds where a shift can't be measured directly.

  Official scorer (evaluation/ from CYP-Challenge-Tutorial)

Why structure-aware, not random, splitting? The real test set was built by hit-expansion — top hits plus purchased chemisimilars — so a random split would overstate performance. Whole fingerprint clusters are held out instead.

Why the official scorer? The published metric (Macro-Averaged Soft-Threshold RAE) measures distance to a compound's credible interval, not a flat error threshold. An early approximation of this metric gave misleadingly optimistic numbers; every result above uses the real code.

🧪 What Didn't Work

Kept here as a record, not just the wins — these are real, validated negative results:

<details> <summary><b>❌ Pseudo-labeling from single-concentration screening data</b> (17.5k extra measurements)</summary> <br>

Linear calibration from log2fc_estimate → pIC50 on overlapping compounds, applied to ~3,000 new compounds per isoform.

CYP2D6: 99% of new compounds fell outside the calibration model's fitted range — a selection-bias artifact, since compounds only reach DRC follow-up because they showed activity at screening.
CYP1A2: actively hurt performance even at low sample weight (MAE 0.690 → 0.999, R² went negative).
Reverted.
</details> <details> <summary><b>❌ Hyperparameter tuning + feature selection</b> (Optuna, 40 trials/isoform)</summary> <br>

MA-ST-RAE 0.758 vs. baseline 0.755 — essentially no change. Every isoform's search converged on keeping the full feature set; dimensionality wasn't the bottleneck.

</details> <details> <summary><b>❌ Structural-alert features for CYP2D6 TDI</b> (bioactivation SMARTS patterns)</summary> <br>

Furans, thiophenes, anilines, and similar reactive-metabolite motifs added as binary flags. No meaningful MCC improvement over fingerprints alone.

</details>

Takeaway: performance is currently bottlenecked by the feature representation, not model choice, tuning, or extra noisy data — motivating a pretrained-embedding experiment (CheMeleon) as the next direction.

⚠️ Known Limitations
CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are the weakest endpoints throughout — smallest training sets, and CYP2D6 additionally uses a different assay technology than the other three isoforms.
All reported numbers use the real official scorer; an earlier flat-threshold ST-RAE approximation used during development is not reflected above.
